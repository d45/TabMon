# TabMon #

## What is TabMon?

TabMon is a performance monitoring agent that periodically samples target hosts for a set of Perfmon and MBean counters and writes out the results to a database in a Tableau-friendly format.  This information can then be used to monitor & analyze performance of a Tableau Server installation, in order to detect potential issues or assess scalability & sizing.

TabMon can be run as both a console app and a Windows service.

## How do I set up TabMon?

TabMon is deployed via a custom installer, which manages dependencies and also bundles Postgres for ease of setup for new users.  To get up and running, follow the instructions in the [installation guide](https://tableau.github.io/TabMon/).

## How do I analyze results from TabMon?

The best way is to explore your results in Tableau!  A [sample workbook](https://github.com/tableau/TabMon/blob/master/TabMon/Resources/Sample%20Workbooks) is included that contains some example dashboards & views to get you started.

## What do I need to build TabMon from source?

The current development requirements are:

1. Windows operating system.
2. Visual Studio 2013 or later.
3. WiX Toolset Visual Studio Extension - Required to build the installer projects.
